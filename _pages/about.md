If you're new here, welcome! I am a first-year PhD student in [Talia Tamarin-Brodsky's](https://taliatamarin.wixsite.com/taliatamarin) group in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](eaps.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I previously attended Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, where I received my B.S. in physics in 2023. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of meteorology, large-scale atmospheric dynamics, and climate science. I am currently working on a project examining the sensitivity of mid-latitude atmospheric predictability to the properties of the mean climate state, such as temperature and moisture. 

Outside of my academic life, I am active as a jazz pianist and composer; you can hear some of my music-making [here](https://lorenbroaddus.bandcamp.com/album/the-sentimental-rebel). I am also fond of movies, running, and [translation](https://cjgliddon.github.io/posts/2025/01/three-poems-by-stephen-crane/).

This website is currently under construction; check back soon for a new and improved version.
