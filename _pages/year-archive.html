*Important note.* Though this blog is still nascent as of the end of 2024, I expect its content to encompass a wide-ranging cross-section of my interests. Many of these interests are "academic" insofar as the academic stance is what I take toward most things in life (for better or for worse), but they extend well beyond the focus of my research at MIT.
