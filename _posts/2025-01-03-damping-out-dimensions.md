*While my primary goal as a graduate student and scientist is to tackle intellectual problems that (in principle) are of some importance to the scientific community, I also love solving interesting problems for their own sake. "Problem of the Day" is a series of posts highlighting some of the less important intellectual exercises I've run across in my readings/studies/what have you. They're trifles, but then again, so many things in life are. - CG*

Mathematician Steven Strogatz' outstanding textbook [*Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429492563/nonlinear-dynamics-chaos-steven-strogatz) begins with a discussion of *flows on the line*: one-dimensional dynamical systems that take the form \\( dx/dt = f(x) \\), where \\( f(x) \\) is an arbitrary function. These systems are straightforward to analyze, so it makes sense that Strogatz opens his treatment of nonlinear dynamics by discussing them. However, they're somewhat limited in their utility as models for actual natural phenomena. 

Importantly, a flow on the line does not allow for oscillations, since in it the time derivative \\( dx/dt \\) is uniquely specified by the system's position \\( x \\). So we can't represent, for instance, the behavior of a generic simple pendulum using a flow on the line. Even though a pendulum may have only one degree of freedom–conventionally, the angle it makes with the vertical \\( θ \\)–
