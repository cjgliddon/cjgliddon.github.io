![Grand Encounter album cover.](https://e.snmc.io/i/fullres/s/d98233281df9f3900aa8d57ba99b6a4d/1986496)

**Pacific Jazz, 1957. Personnel: John Lewis, piano; Bill Perkins, tenor saxophone; Jim Hall, guitar; Percy Heath, bass; Chico Hamilton, drums.**

The title of this album refers to the mixed backgrounds of its personnel. John Lewis and Percy Heath were both New York-based musicians, former members of Dizzy Gillespie's big band who later co-established the Modern Jazz Quartet. Meanwhile, Chico Hamilton, Jim Hall, and Bill Perkins were major players on the Los Angeles scene, although Hall would soon move to New York. All five musicians would have been placed under the so-called "cool jazz" umbrella by contemporaneous critics, a name that signaled a flavor of jazz was built on subtlety and restraint in contrast to the high energy and technical complexity of bebop. (Like any label of this music, "cool jazz" is controversial.)

I must confess that many cool jazz performances on record do not speak to me very strongly. In the hands of some musicians—and unfortunately John Lewis is among their number—"subtlety" and "restraint" become euphemisms for monotony and inexpressiveness. To be sure, Lewis' rather spartan piano style makes more sense, though, if you consider him not as a bebop pianist but a bandleader in the mold of Count Basie, an understated stylist disinterested in feats of pianistic virtuosity. (This is likely how Lewis, who spoke admiringly of Basie in interviews, considered himself.) But the band on *Grand Encounter* doesn't have the deep groove and personality that the Basie band had; their sound is refined but anemic. 

The only cut on *Grand Encounter* which I feel has lasting value is John Lewis' "Two Degrees East, Three Degrees West," an angular, mildly dissonant blues head that has some cerebral appeal.
